This period coincides with the beginning of the rainy season, which provides sufficient moisture for initial plant development. However, it is important to monitor local weather conditions and adapt planting as needed."

During this period, rainfall is more stable and abundant, which ensures a constant supply of water for plant growth. In addition, planting in January allows us to avoid the risks associated with December's torrential rains and flash floods."

      "content": "To improve soil fertility naturally, you can use organic fertilizers such as compost, manure, and cover crops. These materials provide essential nutrients to the soil and promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms. In addition, organic fertilizers help improve soil structure, water retention, and aeration, which are essential for plant growth."
